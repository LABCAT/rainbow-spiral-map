## PS4 MDDN 342 2017

My sketch has been made using screen shots from the pattern I created for problem set three. I choose the pattern as I had already put a lot of thought into how it would look on different canvas sizes. Therefore it already has different levels of when viewed from different zoom levels.

At the widest zoom level there is a repeating pattern created by 3x3 set of different coloured hexagons. When zooming into the mid level, a single hexagon is made from 24 glyph patterns. The glyph patterns are organized into three groups each with a different colour. At the most detailed zoom level you see the finer details of the glyph pattern.  A glyph pattern is created using a randomly selected shape and randomly selected number of rotations.  This creates a wide variety of interesting patterns.
