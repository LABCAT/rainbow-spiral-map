## Rainbow Spiral Map

### Layering Details

My aim for this part of the assignment has been to treat the zooming functionality as an experience.  I have taken this approach because I feel that "zooming in" is the most likely action a viewer would do initially. 

My aim has been to make it feel like the design reveals more details every time the plus button is clicked. This works very well and the design has a lot of variety for each level of zoom.  

At the earlier zoom levels the variation is provided due to the octagon zones getting larger and revealing more of themselves.  In the latter zoom levels, the variation is provided by the glyphs contained within the octagon zones.  Each glyphs starts as a simple shape and as you zoom in the glyphs appear to split and multiply.  The glyphs gradually morph from simple shapes into intricate patterns the deeper you zoom into the canvas.
